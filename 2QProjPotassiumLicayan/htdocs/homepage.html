	<h1> What is the Fate Universe? </h1>
	<p>
		The Fate franchise is essentially one big multiverse that has various timelines that lead it to its unique style of narration.
		Fate mainly revolves around the holy grail war which is essentially various people summoning servants of history from the past, present or future
		to fight and obtain the holy grail. The holy grail is a wish granting device that randomly appears after winning the war. Fate can be watched, read or
		even played in any order because it is essentially one big timeline of events. Of course there are other timelines that diverge from the original such
		as Fate/Prisma Illya which is a universe in where instead of servants they are given class cards that turns masters into that historical figure with a
		magical girl kind of vibe.
